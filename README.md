# Sales-Prediction-based-on-Web-Activity-

Online shopping applications are always trending these days. It is a space where people may go to the website, pick the products they want, fill out the relevant information, pay (or choose to pay later), and buy goods and services in a flash. There are many people who purchase the products on the websites but there is no proof to show that every person i.e. whoever is using the online shopping websites is intended to buy a product. They may be visited to compare the prices with other websites or they can be your competitors. The objective of our work is to predict whether the product will be purchased or not and to find key factors which play a role in making customers buy a product. Performing customer segmentation will optimize promoting techniques, maximize a customer's esteem for business, and make strides in client encounter and fulfillment.
